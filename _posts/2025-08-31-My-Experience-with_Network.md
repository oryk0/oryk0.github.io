I recently passed the CompTIA Network+ exam, but it wasn’t easy—I actually made it on my second attempt.

The first time I took the exam, I underestimated the importance of acronyms. I had studied the concepts and felt comfortable with networking topics like protocols, topologies, and troubleshooting, but when it came to the test, so many questions were packed with abbreviations that I wasn’t 100% confident about. That slowed me down and cost me points.

After that, I changed my strategy. I built a dedicated study list of acronyms, went over them daily, and connected each one with its purpose. I also practiced using flashcards and acronyms-in-context so I wouldn’t get stuck on exam day.

The second attempt I did it after 2 weeks preparing my self, and it went much smoother. Because I knew the acronyms cold, I was able to focus on solving the actual scenarios instead of second-guessing what the terms meant.

In the end, failing the first time turned out to be a good lesson. It showed me exactly where my weak spot was, and once I fixed it, I passed. My biggest advice for anyone preparing is: don’t ignore the acronyms—they can make or break your score.

## How do I recommend to prepare yourself for the Network+

Personally I got lucky that I had a networking class at my college and also did a course where the profesor explain the basics of networking (netmask, IPv4/IPv6, IP classes, subnetting, etc.) so basically I started with a base but if I should do the test again without knowing nothing I'd definitely start buying a course, if you have the money I would buy the hub.totalsem course, is really good, with perfect explanations and easy to understand. If you are looking for a cheaper option you can go to coursera and buy the Dion Training course, I liked it as well but not at the level of the first one. Do not get too cocky if you pass the practice exams with good score because the questions are really tricky, with 2 or more answers being the posible correct answer but just 1 of them is the best option and they only give you ACRONYMS so get used to the acronyms. I would definitly play with flashcards to remember ports and acronyms.

Passing the CompTIA Network+ on my second attempt has been one of the happiest moments in my journey. The feeling of seeing that “Congratulations” screen filled me with pride because I know how much effort I put into studying and pushing through my weak points. This certification isn’t just a piece of paper to me, it represents all the late nights of reviewing concepts, memorizing acronyms, and truly understanding how networks function in the real world. I’ve gained so much knowledge along the way, and now I feel more confident than ever in my IT career path. It’s proof that hard work and persistence really pay off, and it motivates me to keep aiming higher.
