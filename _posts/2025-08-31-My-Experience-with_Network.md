If you do "hostname -I" it will show you your IP as well

And how many IP do we have in the world with IPV4? we do have 2^32 = 4,294,967,296 , and humans in the world are 7.951 billion, that means that we don't have IPs for everybody.
There's another implementation, IPV6, that has more possibilities: 2^128 = 3.4028237e+38.
